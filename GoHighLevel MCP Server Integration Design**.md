# GoHighLevel MCP Server Integration Design**

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and architecture for integrating GoHighLevel with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Our research has revealed that GoHighLevel provides an official, fully-featured MCP server that is live and ready for use. Therefore, the most efficient and robust approach is to leverage this existing infrastructure rather than building a new MCP server from scratch.

This design focuses on configuring a client to connect to the official GoHighLevel MCP server, which will provide the desired management capabilities.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The proposed architecture is a client-server model where:

*   **Client**: Any MCP-compatible client (e.g., a local agent, n8n, a script) that can make HTTP requests.
*   **Server**: The official GoHighLevel MCP server hosted at `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/`.

This architecture eliminates the need for developing and maintaining a custom MCP server, significantly reducing development time and complexity.

## 3. Authentication

Authentication will be handled using a **Private Integration Token (PIT)** from GoHighLevel. This is a secure method that allows for scoped access to the API.

The PIT will be passed in the `Authorization` header of all requests to the MCP server.

## 4. Configuration

The following JSON configuration should be used to connect a client to the GoHighLevel MCP server. The `Authorization` token and `locationId` are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual credentials when they are available.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gohighlevel": {
      "url": "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN>",
        "locationId": "<YOUR_GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Available Tools

The official GoHighLevel MCP server provides a rich set of tools for managing various aspects of the platform. These include:

*   **Contact Management**: Create, update, and retrieve contacts.
*   **Conversation Management**: Send messages and manage conversations.
*   **Calendar Management**: Manage appointments and calendars.
*   **Opportunity Management**: Manage sales pipelines and opportunities.
*   **Payment Management**: Retrieve order and transaction information.

A full list of available tools can be found in the research document: `gohighlevel_api_research.md`.

## 6. Implementation Plan

1.  **Obtain Credentials**: The user needs to provide the Private Integration Token (PIT) and the Location ID from their GoHighLevel account.
2.  **Configure Client**: Use the JSON configuration above to set up the MCP client.
3.  **Test Integration**: Verify the integration by making test calls to the GoHighLevel MCP server.

By following this design, we can achieve the user's goal of managing GoHighLevel through an MCP in a fast, secure, and reliable manner.
